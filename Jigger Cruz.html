<h2>Jigger Cruz "Self Portrait" (2017)</h2>
<h1>Being a color-blind artist, Jigger Cruz’s interpretation of color taps into its more sensorial qualities rather than the visual. He materializes his thoughts on the social and political status of contemporary Philippines by employing techniques such as impasto, cutting, and spraying paint—creating three-dimensional layers of brightly colored pigment. Cruz’s works are displayed in several public collections, including The Dikeou Collection in Denver; Guggenheim Museum in New York; Saatchi Collection in London; and Zabludowicz Collection, also in London.</h1>
