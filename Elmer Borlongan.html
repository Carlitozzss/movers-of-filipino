<h2>Elmer Borlongan"Tampuhan" (1992)</h2>
<h1>Elmer Borlongan began his artist journey young. At the age of 11, he started taking painting lessons from the Father of the Philippine Art Workshop, Fernando Sena. Borlongan’s distinctive use of figurative expressionism displays the influences of the scenes he witnessed growing up in urban Manila, particularly attuned to the social and economic contours of society. He’s a multi-awarded contemporary artist whose distinctions include the CCP's Thirteen Artists Award in 1994.</h1>
