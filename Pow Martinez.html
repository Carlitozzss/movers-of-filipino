<h2>Pow Martinez"The Dreamers" (2022)</h2>
<h1>Pow Martinez offers eclectic playfulness in his works, which call attention to the absurdity of Philippine history, culture, and art. Contrary to his grotesque subjects, his style makes use of explosive colors foregrounded by exaggerated, almost-cartoonish figures. Martinez has exhibited in multiple galleries across the country and the world, including Germany, France, Thailand, and United States, among others. In 2010, he also received a citation from the prestigious Ateneo Art Awards.</h1>
