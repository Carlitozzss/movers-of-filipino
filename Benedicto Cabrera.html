<h2>Benedicto “BenCab” Cabrera"Sabel" (2003)</h2>
    <h1>It’s been over 60 years since Benedicto “BenCab” Cabrera first made a name as an artist of exceptional caliber yet his star continues to burn bright and shows no sign of dimming. As a young boy growing up in Malabon, he was exposed to social ills that made their way into his art, and this awareness never left him even as life led him elsewhere in the world. Upon his return to the motherland, he settled in Baguio, where he eventually opened his namesake museum and where he resides to this day. He has been called many names throughout his career, including the impressive “bestselling painter of his generation,” but BenCab’s most enduring legacy is how his art provides a unique insight into the soul of the Filipino.</h1>
