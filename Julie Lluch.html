<h2>Julie Lluch "Susanna and the Elders" (2015)</h2>
    <h1>In the pantheon of great Filipino artists, there is a distressing dearth of women. It's fortunate, then, that we at least have someone like Julie Lluch. A self-taught sculptor who works primarily with materials such as stone, terracotta, marble, and bronze, Lluch graduated with a degree in philosophy from the University of Santo Tomas and has since become a leading exponent of the feminist movement in Filipino arts and culture. Beyond the immediately apparent figures of her creations, Lluchâ€™s art provides commentary on a range of social and spiritual issues, primarily those that affect women.</h1>
